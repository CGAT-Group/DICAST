Config Files (advanced)
=======================

To change the input/output folders, number of cores and more, it is necessarry to edit certain scripts found in the :guilabel:`scripts/` folder.

Since those files are bash scripts, it is important to mind the syntax rules. E.g., there can't be a whitespace before and after ``=``.
