Setup
=====
DICAST has two main dependencies, Conda and Docker. Setting it up completely however, needs you to build docker images, which takes some time, so it is recommended to get a bit of a headstart. However, should you run DICAST once, the images are cached on your computer and is accessible for later use.

Please follow these steps carefully to set up your working environment.
