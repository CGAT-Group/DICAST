Setup
=====
DICAST has two main dependencies, Conda and Docker. Setting it up completely however, needs you to build docker images, which takes around 2.5 hours, locally, , so it is recommended to get a bit of a headstart. It is faster to just pull them. Either way, should you run DICAST once, the images are cached on your computer and is accessible for later use.

Please follow these steps carefully to set up your working environment.
