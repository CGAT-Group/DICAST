Description:	libGkArrays is a C++ library to build GkArrays.
 .
 GkArrays are a set of arrays that indexes all k-factors of given collection
 of q reads of length m.
 .
 This structure provides constant access to:
   - the number of occurences of a given k-factor ;
   - the number of occurences of a k-factor in at a given position in some read.
 This structure provides linear in the number of occurences access to:
   - the positions of each occurences of a given k-factor ;
   - the number of reads sharing a given k-factor.
 .
 The construction of GkArrays requires O(q x m x k) time and O(q x m) space.
 More peculiarly, if K is the number of distinct k-factors in the given set of
 reads, GkArrays use 2 x (q x (m-k+1)) + K memory words.
 .
