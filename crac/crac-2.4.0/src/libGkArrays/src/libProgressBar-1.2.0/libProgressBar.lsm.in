Platforms:      Built with GNU C++ compiler. g++ version 4.1 works,
                Since the source code support the -Wall, -pedantic and -ansi
                options, non-GNU C++ compiler might work too, but I haven't
                tried it. Valgrind says that no memory leaks are possible on
		each test I have done.
