                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

     As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU
     Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version
     3 of the GNU General Public License.

     "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
     other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

     An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface
     provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
     Library.  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is
     deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

     A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
     Application with the Library.  The particular version of the
     Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the
     "Linked Version".

     The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
     Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source
     code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
     isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked
     Version.

     The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
     object code and/or source code for the Application, including any
     data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
     from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
     Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this
     License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
     facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an
     Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument
     passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy
     of the modified version:

       a. under this License, provided that you make a good faith
          effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not
          supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

       b. under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
          this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material
     from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey
     such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
     incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions
     and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
     following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.

       b. Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
          license document.

  4. Combined Works.

     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
     taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
     portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each
     of the following:

       a. Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
          covered by this License.

       b. Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and
          this license document.

       c. For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
          these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to
          the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

       d. Do one of the following:

            0. Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms
               of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code
               in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the
               user to recombine or relink the Application with a
               modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
               modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by
               section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
               Source.

            1. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
               the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses
               at run time a copy of the Library already present on the
               user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly
               with a modified version of the Library that is
               interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

       e. Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
          otherwise be required to provide such information under
          section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
          information is necessary to install and execute a modified
          version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or
          relinking the Application with a modified version of the
          Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
          Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source
          and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
          you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
          specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
          Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side by side in a single library together with other
     library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered
     by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of
     your choice, if you do both of the following:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of
          it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
          find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to
     time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
     Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered
     version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later
     version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
     and conditions either of that published version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
     as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
     Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the
     GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free
     Software Foundation.

     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
     whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
     shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any
     version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version
     for the Library.
