$Bug 17175: the read had several breaks (including a godd chimera break) and crac was not consider the chimera in the CIGAR, so SA was empty

$Bug 17175: not a bug, just a methodo choice - But in a better world, we should have a XE field and a SA field with a chimeric alignment

$Bug 17175: idem, the read had several breaks (including a good chimera break) and crac was not consider the chimera in the CIGAR because a strand problem (+1 before the junction, -1 after the junction)
